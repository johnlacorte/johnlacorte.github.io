    <h1>About SDL</h1>
    <p>Simple DirectMedia Layer was first created by Sam Lantinga while working for Loki Software. Loki Software ported a number of
popular games to other platforms. SDL uses modules for different APIs to wrap the platform specific stuff into subsystems that
let you use a few functions without worrying about all the details of how things are carried out. It's more than just a graphics
library too. Most of the things you would use in a simple game or in a game engine that would be implemented differently on 
different platforms are a subsystem. It saves you a lot of work writing code for audio, input, multithreading, networking,
different file systems, timers, logging, error handling, and CD-ROMs. There are a couple of additional standard libraries to
choose from if a basic subsystem doesn't offer everything you need.</p>
    <h1>Your first SDL program</h1>
    <p>First thing you are to need to do is include the SDL header. Second thing is SDL needs your main function to be able to take
command line arguments and return an int to work. Your C compiler may not require it but SDL does. Third you need to call SDL_Init() before using
any other SDL functions for them to work. It takes an integer argument to tell it which subsystems to initialize. The constant
SDL_INIT_EVERYTHING is provided to just intialize everything. SDL_INIT_VIDEO and SDL_INIT_AUDIO initialize that subsystem and some other subsystems
by default. <a href = "https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_Init">SDL_INIT() documentation.</a></p>
    <pre><code>#include &ltSDL2/SDL.h&gt

//SDL needs main to return an int and take these arguments to work
int main( int argc, char* args[] )
{
    //Start SDL. This needs to be called before any other SDL stuff. Using SDL_INIT_EVERYTHING is fine until you are familiar with the subsystems.
    SDL_Init( SDL_INIT_EVERYTHING );
    
    //Free up resources and shut down SDL stuff
    SDL_Quit();
    
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
    <h1>Creating a window</h1>
    <p>This program creates a 640 by 480 window centered in the middle of the screen with the title "Hello World!" and immediately destroys it.
The last 0 in the function call is the flag that can be used to do things like display the window full screen and things like that. 
<a href = "https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_CreateWindow">SDL_CreateWindow() documentation.</a></p>
    <pre><code>#include &ltSDL2/SDL.h&gt

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
	//Start SDL
	SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_EVERYTHING);

	//Create a 640 by 480 Centered window named "win" with the title "Hello World!".
	SDL_Window* win = SDL_CreateWindow("Hello World!", SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED, SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED, 640, 480, 0);

	//Destroys window named "win". SDL_Quit() should take care of this but not freeing up your resources is bad practice.
	SDL_DestroyWindow(win);

	//Quit SDL
	SDL_Quit();

	return 0;
}</code></pre>
    <h1>Introducing events</h1>
    <p>SDL has an event queue. The event queue grabs up mouse movements, mouse clicks, keyboard presses, keyboard releases, game controllers
    (if that subsystem is initialized) and other things. Events are initialized if you initialize the video subsystem. A SDL Event is a union
    of all types. You can push events to the event queue if you like. <a href = "https://wiki.libsdl.org/CategoryEvents">Check out documentation 
    to learn how to read events beyond their type.</a>To the last program I added a loop that pops any events off the event queue, stores them
them in the variable "event", and checks if they are a click to the close button on the window (SDL_QUIT) or a keypress (SDL_KEYDOWN).</p>
    <pre><code>#include &ltSDL2/SDL.h&gt

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
	/*----Start Variables---- */
	SDL_Window* win = NULL;
	SDL_Event event;

	int gameLoop = 1;
	/*-----End Variables-----*/

	//Start SDL
	SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_EVERYTHING);

	//Create window named "win".
	win = SDL_CreateWindow("Hello World!", SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED, SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED, 640, 480, 0);

	while(gameLoop)
	{
        //Pop SDL_Event off event queue and store it in my variable until event queue is empty.
        while(SDL_PollEvent(&ampevent))
		{
            //The type of an event gives you what member of the SDL_Event union the event is.
			switch(event.type)
			{
				case SDL_QUIT:
					gameLoop = 0;
					break;
				case SDL_KEYDOWN:
					gameLoop = 0;
					break;
			}
		}
	}
	//Destroys window named "win".
	SDL_DestroyWindow(win);

	//Quit SDL
	SDL_Quit();

	return 0;
}</code></pre>
    <h1>Introducing surfaces</h1>
    <p>An SDL_Window has an SDL_Surface. Get a pointer for the window's surface with SDL_GetWindowSurface().After drawing
    to the window's surface, you need to call SDL_UpdateWindowSurface() for the new updated surface to be displayed.</p>
    <p>Additional surfaces can be created for holding images loaded from a bitmap file and surfaces or regions of surfaces
    can be copied (called a blit) to other surfaces.</p>

    <pre><code>#include &ltSDL2/SDL.h&gt

{
	/*----Start Variables---- */
	//This will hold the pointer to window "win" surface
	SDL_Surface* winSurface = NULL;

	SDL_Window* win = NULL;
	SDL_Event event;
	int gameLoop = 1;
	/*-----End Variables-----*/

	//Start SDL*
	SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO);

	//Insert code here to draw to winSurface

	//Draws whatever is on the window "win" surface to the screen
	SDL_UpdateWindowSurface(win);

    //Wait for an event to close window

	{
		while(SDL_PollEvent(&ampevent))
		{

	//Destroys window named "win".

    <h1>SDL_Rect</h1>
    <p>An <a href = "https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_Rect">SDL_Rect</a> is a structure for defining a rectangular area of a surface. From the 
    header file:</p>
    <pre><code>typedef struct SDL_Rect
    {
        int x, y;
        int w, h;
    } SDL_Rect;</code></pre>
    <p>The x and y are the coordinates of the upper left corner of the SDL_Rect. The w and h are the width and height. SDL uses SDL_Rect
    for selecting the area of a surface for blitting. SDL also provides functions that take SDL_Rects and can be used for collision detection.</p>
    <h1>SDL_FillRect</h1>
    <p>This program fills the </p>
    <p>Other function for simple drawing to a surface can be found here</p>

	SDL_Surface* winSurface = NULL;

	SDL_Window* win = NULL;

	SDL_FillRect(winSurface, NULL, SDL_MapRGB(winSurface-&gtformat, 255, 0, 0) );

	//Draws whatever is on the window "win" surface to the screen
	SDL_UpdateWindowSurface(win);
